# Laundry-clothes-management-system

The laundry management project is crafted to streamline the organization of laundry clothes, offering a range of functionalities. These include retrieving laundry clothes from the database, adding new entries for laundry clothes, updating the status of clothes, deleting items that are no longer in use, and more. The upcoming steps in this project involve csonnecting the project to a database and conducting further testing using Postman. This HTTP API, showcasing CRUD operations, has been developed in Golang. Below are a few references that have been instrumental in guiding me through this project.
