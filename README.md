# Laundry-clothes-management-system

The laundry management project aims to facilitate the organization of laundry clothes. The functionalities include retrieving laundry clothes from the database, adding new entries for laundry clothes, updating the status of clothes, and deleting clothes once they are no longer in use. The next steps involve connecting the project to a database and conducting further testing using Postman.
